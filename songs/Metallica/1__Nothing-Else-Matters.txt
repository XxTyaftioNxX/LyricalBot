[Guitar Intro]

[Verse 1]
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

[Verse 2]
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

[Verse 3]
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus 1]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

[Verse 1]
So close, no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
[Chorus 1]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say
And nothing else matters

[Verse 3]
Trust I seek and I find in you
Everyday, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

[Chorus 2]
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play

[Chorus 1]
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah-yeah!
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 1]
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters
